# Docker
* virtualization tool
* containers - isolated operating system layer (linux - usally alpine)
* repository (pubilc dockerhub)
* you can run different versions of application in docker without having a conflict
* Docker Toolbox -> makes abstraction of OS' kernel if not nativivaly compatible with docker; can be run nativivaly on WIndows 10 for insntance
* docker is by default attched to terminal (the output and input as well as closing terminal) but can be run detached by docker run -d

## ports
* binding between computer porst and container ports has to be made
* more containers can listen to the same port as long as the bindings of hosts are differenet

## docker vs virtual machine
* docker - virtualization of OS' applications layer; uses kernal of the host
* virtual machine - vritualize both kernel and applications layer of OS

## container vs image
* container - running environemnt for image that contains file system and environemnt configuration for instance

## docker network
* parts of app in the same docker network can communiate to each other just by name (no localhost:port etc.)
* parts of app outside docker network needs to specify ports etc.

## terminology
* Images - The blueprints of our application which form the basis of containers. In the demo above, we used the docker pull command to download the busybox image.
* Containers - Created from Docker images and run the actual application. We create a container using docker run which we did using the busybox image that we downloaded. A list of running containers can be seen using the docker ps command.
* Docker Daemon - The background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers. The daemon is the process that runs in the operating system which clients talk to.
* Docker Client - The command line tool that allows the user to interact with the daemon. More generally, there can be other forms of clients too - such as Kitematic which provide a GUI to the users.
* Docker Hub - A registry of Docker images. You can think of the registry as a directory of all available Docker images. If required, one can host their own Docker registries and can use them for pulling images.


## commands 
* docker run hello-world -> for testing installation
* docker pull busybox -> fetches busybox
* docker ps -a -> list containers that were run
* docker run -it busybox sh -> runs docker in interactive mode with attached shell
* docker run --rm <container> -> removes autmatically container after it was run
* docker run postgres:9.6 -> run specific version
* docker image ls - list installed images
* docker run -d - runs image detached from terminal -> id of containger will be printed -> can be used in docker run <id> command
* docker run -p<host_port_num:container_port_num> <image> - runs image and binds host and container ports
* docker stop <container-id> - try to shutdown gracefully
* docker kill <container-id>
* docker run <image-name> --name <your-container-name>
* docker start <container-id> - restarts container as if it was run with docker run with all the options previously used
* docker network ls - lists network (theres already autogenerated one by default)
* docker network create <network-name> - creates docker network
* docker run -net <network-name>
### troubleshooting
* docker logs <container-id or container-name> - to see logs (for instgance from detached container)
* docker exec -it <container-id or container-name> /bin/bash- gets you into interactive terminal of specified container. Then you can run ls or other terminal commands
